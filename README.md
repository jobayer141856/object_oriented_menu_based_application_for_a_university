Defining Multiple Classes

• We want to develop a minimal, simple object-oriented application for a university.
• A university has three major entities: Students, Faculties and Courses.
• First, we have to identify the relationships among them.
• The following relationship diagram shows the relationships among Student, Course, Faculty class
and IEnrollable interface.


Developing a Menu-based Application
• Now, we need to develop a menu-based, command line application.
• The initial menu may have the following options:
a. Add
b. Delete
c. Update
d. Print
e. Search
f. Exit Program
• For each of these options, we may provide further options. Suppose, for ‘Add’ option, next we 
may show the following options:
a. Add a Student
b. Add a Course
c. Add a Faculty
 For ‘Delete’ and ‘Update’, we may provide the same options.
• For ‘Print’ option, we may further provide the followings:
a. Print all students
b. Print all course
c. Print all faculties
d. Print information of a student
e. Print information of a course
f. Print information of a faculty
g. Print student list and faculty information of a course
h. Print courses taken by a student
• Search is very important feature in our application. For ‘Search’ option, we may provide the 
followings:
a. Search a Student by Id or Name
b. Search a Course by Id
c. Search a Faculty By Id or Name
d. Search whether a student takes a course
e. Search whether a faculty teaches a course
f. Search courses taken by a student
g. Search courses taught by a faculty
